                     <p>
                         To many the Web is a mystery that can only be unlocked by a
 <em>nerd</em>. But how the Web works can be quite facinating to many. Basically, it's a huge network of computers talking to each other.
When your browser (Internet Explorer, Chrome, etc.) requests a web page the request is routed to the server that has the page.
That server then sends the requested document to your computer to display. The problem is that computers don't speak English.
 English, as are most human languages, is ambiguous. The main language for the Web is HTML (HyperText Markup Language). 
HTTP is the "grammer" of the Web. Url's are the addresses for the pages and files you are looking for. The Web was created in the early 1990's.
 It currently has about 30 billion pages.

                     <p>
                         HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
 HTML documents form the majority of the content on the Web. HTML is made up of: 1) Text Content - What you see, 2) Markup - How your content looks, 
3) References to other documents e.g. Images and Videos, 4) Links to other pages

                     <p>
                         HTML documents are made of HTML elements.
 An element is made up of an opening tag, contents (the information you want to convey)
 , and a closing tag. The opening tag can also contain attributes that assist in coding and style.

                         Spock is very logical and also very literal. Agononizingly so.
 Computers aer just like that. Computers want everything exactly right. Spelling, syntax, indentation - everything has to be just right. Computers don't deal with ambiguity. If your code has issues then the computer will tell you. 
 Usually that means ugly error messages that leave you scratching your head wondering what it means.

                         Some HTML elements just can't get out of the box.
 For instance p, div, and h> are examples of tags that form an invisible (or visible if you choose) 
box or block around the contents. Other tags are strickly in-line. Like for instance, the span tag

                         The tools programmers use are designed to aid the programmer.
 If you're going to get that HTML treed you're going to need the best tools you can get! 
Here are the tools we have covered so far - 1) Scratchpad - great for quick coding jobs, 2) Sublime Text - an awesome and helpful tool for coding HTML, CSS and Python, 3) 
CodePen - a great tool for HTML and CSS because it lets you see right away when you make changes to the code

When it comes to HTML, being in the box is a good thing. Some HTML elements can contain many other HTML elements which in turn can contain many other HTML elements, and so on
, and so on.... This nesting of elements (think boxes) shows up as indentations in the code according to how many elements it is nested in.
 This gives rise to the idea of 'treeing' HTML

                     <p>
                         If you are doing a good job of writing code then you indent as you go deeper into the nested boxes. The greater the indentation, the deeper in the
 nested boxes you are. Not indenting causes the code to be hard to read and can all create errors

                         No one likes to write the same code over and over. It's boring and it takes up time and space. More than that it means more errors and more debugging. Even more,
 what happens when your boss says he or she wants a different font used - and it's in fifty places in your code! HTML has an answer for that. Defining classes helps from repeating code over and over again. 
 If you need to make a change then it happens once in the class definition

                     <p>
                         CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes HTML look good. This is a seperate language that addresses all the style issues that HTML has. The HTML must link to the corresponding CSS file.
 This gives the programmer the ability to change the way a page looks without changing the HTML. It also greatly assists in creating a common theme among related webpages.

                     <p>
                         Computers are designed to run a specific sequence of instructions. It will do that time after time after time.... Then when a new set of instruction is needed the computer can start runnning those instructions.
That specific set of instructions to the computer is called the 'program'.

                     <p>
                         Computers need the instructions in a very specific way. The programming language helps us 'illogical' humans get the instructions right for the computer. Python is a high-level language designed take the code your write and convert it into the instructions the computer needs.
 This 'conversion' is done by the Python interpreter when you press 'run' or 'build'.

                     <p>
                         Well, yes and no. Python has a grammer and syntax as English does. Past that though they are not very similar. English is full of ambiguity. As we said before computers don't deal well with that. Python is made up of a set of expressions that must conform to its syntax and grammer.
Failing to do so means errors. That's because Pythin needs to be instructed exactly. Close doesn't count at all.....

                         Variable give programmer a way of keeping up with values. In a way it is 'naming a value'. Obviously though the variable name stays the same even if the value it points to changes.
 This gives a programmer a great deal of flexibility in writing code.

                     <p>
                         Let's say we have a variable name we want to use. Let's call it red_jelly_beans. Now we want to assign a value of 30 to it. Here's what the code looks like: 'red_jelly_beans=30'. 
 The value of red_jelly_beans can be changed as the program is run.

                     <p>
                         The short answer is no. in math the equals sign means 'is the same as'. In Python (and any other programming language) the equals sign means 
'takes the value of'.

                         Programs handle repetitive tasks easily. Many times a program may need to use the same code over and over.
 This is where a function comes in. You define the function based on the input you need to give it. and the output you expect. The function then does the required code over and over every time it is called in the program.

                         Function are defined by the first line of the function starting with the keyword 'def' followed by the name and then input parameters in parentheses. The body of the function comes next.
 This is the code that is the job you need the function to perform. The code must be indented under the defining statement. Last it ends with a 'return' keyword and the values being passed back to the program.
  When the main program neds to use the function it is called by using the name of the function followed by the input parameters in parentheses.

                         Functions have to follow the same grammer rules the the main Python program follows. This means that the 'def'statement has to follow the correct syntax as well as the body and return statement.
 Failure to follow the correct sytax will cause some crazy errors. Failure to 'call the function' correctly from the main program will also mean incorrect or no output from the function. Failure to include the 'return statement' will get you this when it is called: 'none'

                         Programs need to make decisions just like humans do. They also need a way to do those same old boring tasks the number of times requested of them. That's where the 'if' and 'while' statements come in

                         The 'if' statement runs a block of code depending on the evauation of a conditional expression. If the expression evaluates to boolean True then the block of code is run. If the expression evauates to boolean False then the the next line following the conditional code is run.

                         The 'while' statement will loop on a block of code. The while loop is created by the 'while statement' The code is run time after time until the expression included in the 'while' statement is no longer true. Then program execution falls to the next line of code after the 'while' block.

                         A string is a sequence of characters. They can be letters, numbers, or symbols. A list on the other hand can be a sequence of anything.

                         A list can be a sequence of anything. That includes strings, and numbers. What really makes lists so powerfule is that they can also include other lists. So a list can be any sequence of strings, numbers or lists.

                         lists support mutation. In other words, we can change the value of a list after we have created it.You can change the elements of a list you create. You can also add additional elements to a list

                         Aliasing is two different ways of refering to the same object. For instance when we assign the value of a list element to a variable then both the variable name and the List point to the same object.

                         for loops give the programmer a great way to work through a list. The syntax is 'for <name> in <list>:'. This will set up a loop that will execute a block of code for each element in <list>
